# Lico Arc Reliable Exchange v1

Status: Candidate. This document is the normative projection of the machine
sources in [`spec/v1/reliable`](../../spec/v1/reliable/) and the positive and
negative corpus in [`conformance/v1/reliable`](../../conformance/v1/reliable/).
It does not authorize publication, a database, a queue implementation, or an
application effect.

## Boundary and guarantees

Reliable Exchange is the Endpoint-protected state layer between Generic
Messaging and application-owned effects. It carries one stable Protected
Intent and logical Message identity through an at-least-once path whenever a
conforming path is available. A Station may receive, drop, delay, replay,
reorder, suppress, or misreport a packet; a Station signal is only an
untrusted transport hint and never advances Endpoint Accepted or Effect
Completed.

The profile deliberately does not promise exactly-once local effects,
guaranteed Station delivery, trusted time, a retry scheduler, or a storage
engine. The application receives a bounded idempotency input and owns effect
idempotency. Reusing an idempotency input for different canonical meaning is a
conflict without a second execution.

## Stable intent and retry

The Protected Intent digest covers the stable logical Message identity,
application idempotency input, exact User Payload bytes, content type, and
peer-visible meaning (plus any complete attachment or Group projection
commitment). A retry with the same Route reuses the exact protected packet
bytes retained in the committed outbox snapshot. A Route change may re-protect
the same Protected Intent and produces a new transport packet, but it cannot
create a second authorization or effect. Send atomically commits the advanced
snapshot and exact retry packet before emission. Restart restores that
complete monotonic snapshot before processing new input; a lower generation
is `state-rollback` and emits no packet or effect. Restart never discovers a retired state root or rewinds replay/nonce state.
Retry and other processing budgets may resume in a new bounded turn; accepted
work has no lifetime expiry.

Each metadata-only event names the expected snapshot generation and is
validated against the complete immutable current snapshot before one atomic
compare-and-commit. An event never embeds protected packet bytes. The tagged
states are data, not a class
hierarchy: outbox states are `created`, `in-flight`, `ambiguous`, `accepted`,
`completed`, `cancelled`, and `failed`; inbox states additionally include
`new`, `accepted`, and `effect-pending`. A same-identity, same-bytes
replay is idempotent. The same identity with a different protected meaning is
`intent-conflict` and cannot mutate state.

`ambiguous` records preserve the intent for a caller-selected retry. Known terminal effects cannot authorize a second execution. Late authenticated
facts remain admissible; timeouts and cancellation intent are not terminal facts.
Retry/route/transition limits bound a processing turn, not a logical message.
Persist unresolved task and replay state beyond the bounded working set.

Accounting is disjoint and exact: a canonical Protected Intent is at most
262,558 octets; event metadata is at most 4,294 octets; one retained protected
packet is at most 524,288 octets; and snapshot metadata is at most 4,589
octets, for a total snapshot maximum of 528,877 octets. A confirmation is at
most 607 octets. Bounded counters, high-water values, and tombstones replace
event histories. Rejected, stale, conflicting, replayed, or over-bound input
returns the byte-identical pre-state and emits no packet or application effect.

## Endpoint confirmation and effects

One Endpoint confirmation has one stage, one outcome, one optional failure
code, and one sorted unique `confirmedMessageIds` array. The array is bounded
by `MAX_CONFIRMATION_IDS`; different stages or outcomes require separate
confirmation identities. A duplicate confirmation is accepted only when its
canonical bytes match. A different result for one confirmation identity is a
`evidence-conflict` for reconciliation, not an arrival-order winner.

Confirmation identifiers derive from fact content and Endpoint, not a transport
session. Successful completion may arrive before acceptance; result content can
be verified later against its recorded digest. The stages are exactly:

1. Endpoint Accepted: the exact protected authorized Endpoint confirmation
   reports that the record was accepted and deduplicated.
2. Effect Completed: the exact protected authorized Endpoint confirmation has
   outcome `succeeded` and binds the caller-owned local result digest.

The closed confirmation outcomes are `succeeded`, `rejected`, and `failed`.
Pending work and transport ambiguity are local/transport states, never Endpoint
confirmation values. Station Received remains only a non-authoritative hint.

Endpoint Accepted and Effect Completed cannot be advanced from a Station
receipt, queue possession, lease, timestamp, or Station signature. The
Reliable Exchange machine does not execute or deduplicate application effects;
it supplies the idempotency input and records the Endpoint result.

## Attachments and Group projections

Attachment recovery reuses Generic Messaging's fixed chunk grid and bounded
Receive State. A non-empty range request is selective recovery feedback; a
successful chunk does not generate a routine confirmation. Empty ranges are
valid only after exact length and whole-content digest verification. Attachment
completion additionally requires the matching authenticated Endpoint
confirmation. Completion and confirmed stop prevent reexecution, not receipt of late facts.
A local cancel request is not a confirmed stop; missing results remain unknown.

Group delivery keeps one stable projection identity per recipient. Results are
sorted by recipient Endpoint reference and are independently `pending`,
`delivered`, `rejected`, or `failed`. The aggregate is `complete` only when all
members are delivered, `failed` only when every member is terminal and none is
delivered, and `partial` otherwise. A member result is authorized only by the
matching protected Endpoint confirmation; Station results cannot change the
aggregate.

## Conformance and privacy

The focused suite [`tests/reliable-confirmations.test.mjs`](../../tests/reliable-confirmations.test.mjs)
checks deterministic CBOR, exact stable intent and packet retry behavior,
Route migration, application idempotency conflict, confirmations, attachment
recovery, Group partial failure, restart snapshots, typed terminal outcomes,
and the adversarial corpus. Fixtures contain only synthetic bytes and bounded
reason classes. No scheduler, storage layout, plaintext runtime data, Station
queue state, or application command meaning is part of this profile.

## Durable continuity and current admission

The current V1 lifecycle contract is [durable continuity](../../spec/v1/reliable/continuity.md).
[Live capabilities](../../spec/v1/messaging/capabilities.md) update existing conversations
without rebind. [Group continuity](../../spec/v1/group/continuity.md) separates history,
effects and fork recovery. The revised Candidate is PARTIAL pending formal requalification;
retained earlier proof output is not current evidence.
