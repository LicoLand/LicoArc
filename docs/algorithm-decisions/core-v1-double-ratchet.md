## Question and scope

Which exact implementation-neutral Double Ratchet construction closes Core v1
initialization from the hybrid handshake, DH transitions, root/send/receive
KDFs, authenticated header, message-key and nonce derivation, skipped-key and
replay state, rollback/restart behavior, deletion transitions, resource
bounds, and compromise claims? The decision does not add a common field,
select a Provider, or claim ongoing post-quantum recovery.

## Primary lineage and Algorithm Prototype

The selected construction is the classic X25519 Double Ratchet initialized by
the approved hybrid AKE. Double Ratchet lineage and HKDF/AEAD standards are
comparative evidence; this record is the LicoArc authority for the exact
composition, state boundary, and failure semantics.

The closed LicoArc Algorithm Prototype is:

1. **Initialization.** The initiator ephemeral X25519 public key and the
   responder's redeemed X25519 one-time prekey are transferred into committed
   session state with the hybrid root. HKDF-SHA-256 derives a root secret and
   role-separated sending and receiving chains. The two peers derive opposite
   directions from the same authenticated context; no counter-only or
   implementation-selected initialization is valid.
2. **Message keys and framing.** Each chain step derives exactly one 32-byte
   ChaCha20-Poly1305 key and one 12-byte nonce. A protected record is the
   canonical plaintext ratchet header followed by ciphertext and its 16-byte
   tag. The header carries the authenticated DH ratchet public key, previous
   sending-chain length (`PN`), and message number (`N`). Its associated data
   is the session-context digest concatenated with the complete canonical
   header. Header confidentiality is not claimed.
3. **DH ratchet.** A newly authenticated peer DH public key advances the root
   and resets the applicable sending/receiving chain according to the fixed
   role-separated KDF domains. A stale key, invalid key, missing predecessor,
   counter wrap, or over-bound transition fails without state mutation.
4. **Skipped and replay state.** Before a DH transition, skipped keys are
   derived only up to the immutable skip bound. They are indexed by the tuple
   `(ratchet-public-key, message-number)` in a bounded hash map for O(1)
   lookup. A consumed key is removed; a duplicate, stale, or over-bound
   message fails closed and cannot allocate an unbounded history.
5. **Atomic send and receive.** Send durably commits the advanced chain and
   exact retryable packet before emission. Receive authenticates against a
   tentative snapshot, then atomically commits ratchet advance, skipped-key
   changes, replay state, and durable inbox state before releasing plaintext.
   An authentication, parse, bound, or persistence failure returns the
   unchanged pre-state.
6. **Restart, rollback, and deletion.** Restart restores the last committed
   monotonic state version. A lower restored generation returns typed
   `state-rollback` and emits neither packet nor plaintext. Deletion makes
   prior keys and prekey use unreachable after the specified transition;
   physical zeroization and resistance to a fully compromised store remain
   explicit provider/proof assumptions, not wire claims.

### Frozen ratchet constraints

| Area | Core v1 constraint |
| --- | --- |
| Ratchet primitive | Classic raw X25519 DH ratchet; no Triple Ratchet, ML-KEM Braid, or component fallback |
| KDF | HKDF-SHA-256 with fixed NUL-terminated ASCII domains and role-separated labels |
| Header | Plaintext but authenticated DH public key, `PN`, and `N`; canonical deterministic representation |
| Record | Header, ciphertext, then 16-byte ChaCha20-Poly1305 tag |
| Associated data | Session-context digest plus the complete canonical header |
| Message key | One 32-byte AEAD key and one 12-byte nonce per chain step |
| Lookup | Bounded map keyed by `(ratchet-public-key, message-number)`; no linear unbounded scan |
| Mutation | Authenticate and validate against tentative state; commit once, then deliver plaintext |
| Future security | Ongoing post-quantum post-compromise recovery is an explicit nonclaim and future Profile scope |

## Necessity and alternatives

An epoch, direction, and counter cannot represent a DH ratchet transition and
does not provide the required asynchronous out-of-order and replay semantics.
The selected classic construction supplies forward key evolution and classic
post-compromise recovery within a bounded state contract. A counter-only
frame, implementation-local ratchet, unbounded skipped-key list, or custom
post-quantum chain without an independent proof is rejected. A future
post-quantum ratchet must be a separately decided complete Profile and cannot
be silently negotiated or used as fallback.

## Security and technical evaluation

| Dimension | Assessment |
| --- | --- |
| Correctness and security claims | Initialization, DH transitions, KDF order, framing, skipped-key indexing, replay, persistence, and deletion are fixed; formal claims remain separately bound. |
| Known attacks and limitations | Replays, stale DH keys, skipped-key exhaustion, counter overflow, rollback, compromised state, and plaintext header metadata are explicit cases; header confidentiality and ongoing PQ recovery are nonclaims. |
| Misuse and failure behavior | Invalid, unauthenticated, stale, duplicate, over-bound, or persistence-failing inputs preserve the prior state and return typed failure. |
| Side channels and secret handling | Endpoint implementations own constant-time DH/AEAD, key erasure, memory protection, and provider behavior. |
| Interoperability | One classic X25519 construction and one canonical header/framing rule are selected; generic counters or Provider conventions cannot substitute. |
| Normative CPU work bound by operation | Chain, DH, skipped-key, and AEAD work is capped by the exact Profile operation bounds. |
| Normative memory and state bounds | Skipped keys, replay state, chain state, durable inbox, and retry packet are bounded and non-refreshable by a Station. |
| Persistent protocol state | Atomic monotonic snapshots are required; restoration below the committed generation fails closed. |
| Capability and handshake wire bytes | Initialization inherits the hybrid AKE and does not add a second ratchet negotiation surface. |
| Established-record and control wire bytes | Header, ciphertext, tag, associated data, and bounded control records are fixed by the selected Profile. |
| Work and allocation before peer authentication | Header parsing and candidate skipping are bounded before AEAD authentication; no attacker-sized map is admitted. |
| Agility, downgrade, replacement, and retirement | The Profile selects the whole ratchet. A semantic replacement requires a new decision, Profile identity, and authenticated complete line; no fallback or translation is allowed. |

## Source-derived conformance material

The decision fixes the future authority-vector classes: valid initialization;
opposite role chains; deterministic root/chain/message/nonce derivation;
canonical header and record framing; wrong session context; invalid/all-zero
DH; first-message, DH-transition, skipped, out-of-order, duplicate, stale,
counter-overflow, and over-bound inputs; atomic send/receive retry;
concurrent commit; restart; lower-generation rollback; deletion; and
no-mutation-on-failure. Expected values derive from this Prototype in
`conformance/v1/protection/`, never from an implementation.

## Decision outcome

`OPEN → READY → DECIDED` is closed in this bounded authority change. The
explicit outcome adopts the classic X25519 Double Ratchet, canonical
authenticated plaintext `DH/PN/N` header, ChaCha20-Poly1305 record framing,
bounded tuple-indexed skipped-key state, atomic persistence, and the explicit
nonclaim boundary. The joined Profile, formal, conformance, registry, and
Candidate Protocol Line authorities close the definition.

## Definition evidence

The decision status is `DECIDED` and the definition status is `SPECIFIED`.
The exact schemas, labels, bounds, vectors, formal bindings, and aggregate
line admission close the selected construction.

## Comparative evidence, never authority

RFC-7748, RFC-5869, RFC-8439, and published Double Ratchet lineage inform
primitive behavior and known risks only. They cannot define LicoArc fields,
state, trust, or Protocol Line meaning.

Current V1 continuity revision reopens formal admission. See [the continuity decision](durable-continuity-live-capabilities.md). Prior proof output is not evidence for the revised transcript or admission.
