# Lico Arc Protocol

[简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

Lico Arc Protocol is LicoLand's implementation-neutral **Protocol Layer**. It
owns protocol meaning: closed schemas and registries, deterministic wire
representations, security and lifecycle rules, definition-level conformance
corpora, content-addressed Protocol Line artifacts, and federation governance.

Products and implementations may execute an exact pinned definition or submit
proposals, but they cannot redefine it. Publication, implementation,
interoperability execution, audit, deployment, support, and operation remain
separate downstream concerns.

LicoArc now separates **standard Nostr interoperability** from **open enhanced
Endpoint and collaboration contracts**. A client implementing the common
NIP-17/44/59 baseline can exchange ordinary private messages with other
supporting Nostr clients without LicoUp, native Station APIs or federation
membership. Enhanced peers add the independently specified LicoArc binding,
not a private client allowlist. See [Nostr interoperability](docs/protocols/nostr-interoperability-v1.md).

The native Protocol Line described below remains the complete enhanced
composition; it is not a prerequisite for ordinary Nostr chat. These are
protocol definitions, not a claim of an implemented or audited Nostr client.

## Core Domain Model

This section is the sole authority for LicoArc's three domain entities.

| Entity | Definition | Authority boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Endpoint** | A user-controlled origin or destination of protected communication. Every independently key-holding device or isolated runtime is a separate Endpoint. | Sole runtime authority for its own keys, sessions, plaintext, protected state, peer acceptance, local approval, effects, and authenticated confirmations. |
| **Station** | An independently operated intermediary that transports opaque endpoint-protected data. | Untrusted by Endpoints. It has no user or device roster and only the transport authority explicitly granted by the pinned Protocol Line. |
| **Network** | A federation interoperability context whose participants recognize communication under one pinned Protocol Line. | Provides recognition and transport context; it is not a trust root, identity authority, plaintext authority, or endpoint security authority. |

```text
Endpoint A ── endpoint-protected LicoArc exchange ──▶
    Network { one or more untrusted Stations } ──▶ Endpoint B
```

Every independently key-holding device or isolated runtime is a distinct
Endpoint. A Group is a protected collaboration object whose members are
Endpoints, not a fourth entity.

## Current Definition

The tracked source graph defines `licoarc.protocol-line.v1` as:

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Lifecycle | `Candidate` |
| Definition status | `COMPLETE` |
| New-session eligibility | `true` |
| Publication eligibility | `false` |
| Protocol generation | `1` (Generation 1) |
| Mandatory capabilities | 8, all `COMPLETE` |
| Active Protection Profile | `stable-core`, `COMPLETE` |

The eight mandatory capabilities are Protocol Foundation, Identity, Pairwise
Protection, Generic Messaging, Reliable Exchange, HTTPS Transport, Group
Collaboration, and Federation Governance.

Identity defines a user-authorized authority chain for multiple independent
Endpoint devices and recovery. Each device keeps its own Endpoint keys and
sessions. Pairwise transcripts bind both Endpoint-state digests and their
sibling user-authority-state digests without creating a digest cycle. An exact
protected Endpoint confirmation, rather than a Station signal, advances
reliable finality. User/device authorization and local peer trust remain
separate decisions.

`stable-core` is an indivisible hybrid construction with paired X25519 and
ML-KEM-768 one-time prekeys, dual Ed25519 and ML-DSA-65 authentication,
fixed transcript-bound admission and confirmation, and a bounded X25519 Double
Ratchet. Profile and Protocol Line identities are computed from named,
non-circular semantic projections. Proof admission, security accounting, and
the complete declared conformance corpus are part of definition admission.

`sessionEligible: true` means the Candidate definition permits authenticated
sessions under the fixed V1 definition (Generation 1). It does not mean Published,
implemented, interoperable, audited, deployed, supported, or operational.

`publicationEligible: false` means this Candidate is ineligible for Protocol-Line
publication. Repository source, license, and documentation may still be published
as repository material under Apache-2.0.
